## Running eBPF programs with Zig

This is an experiment of creating and running eBPF programs with Zig and libbpf.

### Building

This project requires latest zig version (`0.12.0-dev.1836+dd189a35` at the time of writing).

Fetch the submodule

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Build the project

```
zig build
```

BPF object is going to be saved in `src/artifacts` and the main executable is going to be placed in `zig-out/bin`.
The customization of paths can be performed through `build.zig`.

### Summary

First step: compile eBPF objects via `zig build`.
This requires using the `freestanding` OS tag and curate the endianness of target machine.

The produced object file can be loaded via `bpftool` to test it.
This is how I found out the "license" section was misplaced.

```

```

Using `linksection` we can manipulate the ELF linker sections.
We want to use `@cImport`to interop with the Linux kernel C libraries defining BPF helpers, so we can then call into them inside our eBPF programs.
The Zig std library also has some BPF helpers, but they are not as complete as libbpf.

Second step: using `@embed` to load the object file inside the final binary at compile time.
This allows to ship the same code in a single binary.

Third step: create a perf event to attach the eBPF program to.

We use a beautiful library called [`zbpf`](https://github.com/tw4452852/zbpf) that took parts of the very first implementation of BPF bindings and adds libbpf support (via `cInclude`).
The result is a main program that can load a pre-built BPF object and attach it into perf events or call other BPF utilities via libbpf helpers.
